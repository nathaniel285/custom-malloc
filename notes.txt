# Notes 3/10

brk increases only after calling malloc like 10 times, meaning it is using brk so that is pretty cool

cannot use printf or anything that uses malloc under the hood as it will then segfault
but cool to see that if you use printf it will print the thing of malloc i believe because it is using malloc
